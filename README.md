It's an extended Shape language in the MPS tutorial, which has got more beautiful user interface.

# How to use

Download [MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps) for your operating system, and open this project with it.

And open the 'sandbox' node in the logical view, enjoy playing with it.

# Why I build a language like this

Because the official MPS tutorial provides a sample, which is called Shape, is very similiar with this language.

Actually, this language is a thin extension of the one mentioned above. I added color highlighting and concept constrains.

With more features, constrains, behaviors, and abstractions.

You can learn MPS by viewing this project.

# Build

This language is built using MPS EAP 2017.1
